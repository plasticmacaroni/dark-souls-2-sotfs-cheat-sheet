Here is Xeneval's original message:
I'd like to extend a HUGE thanks to [Stephen McNabb](https://github.com/smcnabb) for creating the original [Dark Souls 2 Cheat Sheet](http://smcnabb.github.io/dark-souls-2-cheat-sheet/), [MuFeR](https://github.com/MuFeR), [Rafal Hejna](https://github.com/Rejna), and [TheParty020](https://github.com/TheParty020) for many SotFS additions, and [Zachary Kjellberg](https://github.com/ZKjellberg) for the [Dark Souls 3 Cheat Sheet](http://zkjellberg.github.io/dark-souls-3-cheat-sheet/) from which I borrowed some design elements. If I missed crediting someone please let me know!

Furthermore, I wouldn't have made it through this with my sanity intact if it weren't for the walkthroughs from [FightinCowboy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9N0DmacOi4iWKQyygX89OQ) and [BlueLizardJello](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ59sO0IQRmYHQwcfC5exzw), so go stop by their channels sometime and check out their amazing content.
